												<h2>What is BESSER?</h2>
												<p>Besser is an app that is supposed to implement an employee suggestion system for the Zublin coorporation. Its purpose is relatively simple: employees submit ideas, reviewers review ideas, and admin users manage a mix of both of these user types. This application will be used by the HR department to get employees involved in the project development side of management.</p>

												<h2>Motivation</h2>
												<p>Our motivation for creating the Besser application is almost as simple as its purpose. We really had an interest when we came across this topic because we felt that over the course of a semester we could design, create, and implement a soulution to their HR problem. We saw this as a great opportunity to do some work for a company and also, implement internationalization into an application since there would be a requirement that the application be coded in at least German and English.</p>

												<h2>Project Goals</h2>
												<p>The Employee Suggestion system we created consists of 3 user types. An employee that is allowed to submit new ideas to management, a reviewer that is allowed to rank, comment on, and order ideas an employee submits, and an admin user that is capable of managing both these user types, as well as performing all the actions of a reviewer. All users log into a login page that is entirely managed by the application, without google authentication. Users that are not registered users are required to register. They will then have to be approved by an admin user before they are allowed to use the app. The employee from their home screen can change things about their profile, submit ideas to be reviewed, see old submitted ideas, and see ideas that have been approved from all employees so they can get an idea of what good ideas look like. The reviewer from their home page has the option to look at approved ideas and look at ideas that are waiting to be approved or denied. The reviewer can look at pending ideas and click on them and edit them, add comments that other reviewers can also see, and choose to approve an idea. They can then go to the approved ideas section to view all the ideas they have deemed approvable. The admin user is allowed to do everything that the reviewer is able to do as well as view a list of the users that the application currently has. The admin user can change all aspects of a user, as well as change the password of the user and change whether or not the user is an admin, employee or reviewer.</p>
